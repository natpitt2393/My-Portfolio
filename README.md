Project Name: My-Portfolio


Contributors: Nathaniel (Nat) Epstein

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3

Description: Created a new professional portfolio from scratch. Added header and section semantic elements and had three sections for: About Me, Work, and Contact Me. The first work has a bigger border and image then the other two works as per the directions of the assignment. There are hover psuedo elements for the links in the nav bar and in the contact me section. The about me section has a recent photo and a short bio about myself.

Added alt attributes to all images to improve search engine optimization and for accessibility for the visually impaired.
