            <p>I am a film buff who holds two degrees (BA-University of Chicago in Cinema and Media Studies and MA-The
                New School in Media Studies) who is currently looking to enter the wonderful world of coding! I live in
                NYC and have a cat named Orbison, named after the singer Roy Orbison and have experience in A/V and
                technical assistanships as well as teaching at the university level and working with kids (from my time
                at the Family Experience Store, CAMP).</p>

                    <p>Technologies: Javascript, HTML 5, CSS 3. This project allows the user to create a randomly generated password based on whether the user chooses to use special characters, numbers, and uppercase and lowercase letters.</p>

                    <h3>A Quiz About the Sopranos</h3>

                    <p>Technologies: Javascript, HTML 5, CSS 3. I created a quiz that is about New Jersey's favorite infamous crime family: the Sopranos. The user is asked to answer five questions. If they are incorrect ten seconds are deducted from the timer. The end score is equal to how much time is left on the clock. At the end the user can save their initials associated with their score.</p>

                            alt="Picture of snow on trees and ground" /></a>
                    <p>Technologies used: CSS 3 (Bootstrap), HTML 5, Javascript (jQuery, moment.js). I created a day planner that allows the user to say what they have done in the past, what they plan to do in the future, and what they are doing presently. The past, present and future time blocks all have designated color codes that will change according to the current time. This is able to be executed using moment.js. At the end the user can save what their day looked like in local storage. </p>
